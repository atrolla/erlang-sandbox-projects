## A BRIEF HISTORY

#VSLIDE

- 1980s : Researches in Ericsson's Computer Science Laboratory
- 1986 : NO Existing language suits Telecom constraints -> Need to create a new one
- 1987 : Erlang is prototyped by Joe Armstong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams
- 1987 : Internal project based on Erlang -> First users and rapid changes
- 1989 : Project done -> average increase in productivity factor of 8
- 1995 : AXE-N (Large Project) collapsed -> new AXD project rewritten in Erlang -> OTP
- ->1997 : Expansion -> Performance, Community, Distributed, Projects, BEAM VM, Functional
- 1998 : ADX Project announced, Open-source Erlang following Ericsson's ban -> Mnesia storage, High-Performance, more FP
- Today : Amazon SimpleDB, Ejabberd, RabbitMQ, WhatsApp

#### Constraints

1. Handling a very large number of concurrent activities
2. Actions to be performed at a certain point of time or within a certain time
3. Systems distributed over several computers
4. Interaction with hardware
5. Very large software systems
6. Complex functionality such as feature interaction
7. Continuous operation over several years
8. Software maintenance (reconfiguration, etc.) without stopping the system
9. Stringent quality and reliability requirements
10. Fault tolerance both to hardware failures and software errors
