## A BRIEF HISTORY

#VSLIDE

#### The beginning

1985-1986 : Researches in Ericsson's Computer Science Laboratory

*LISP, ADA, ML, SmallTalk, Prolog, Parlog...*

#VSLIDE

#### Constraints

- Handling a very large number of concurrent activities
- High Availability
- Systems distributed over several computers
- Very large software systems
- Continuous operation over several years
- Software maintenance without stopping the system
- Stringent quality and reliability
- Fault tolerance

#### Erlang's birth
- 1986 : NO Existing language suits Telecom constraints -> Need to create a new one
- 1987 : Erlang is prototyped by Joe Armstong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams
- 1987 : Internal project based on Erlang -> First users (team of 3) and rapid changes made based on their needs
- 1989 : Project done -> average increase in productivity factor of 8

#### The growth
- 1995 : AXE-N (Large Project) collapsed -> new AXD project rewritten in Erlang -> OTP
- ->1997 : Expansion -> Performance, Community, Distributed, Projects, BEAM VM, Functional
- 1998 : ADX Project announced, Open-source Erlang following Ericsson's ban -> Mnesia storage, High-Performance, more FP
- Today : Amazon SimpleDB, Ejabberd, RabbitMQ, WhatsApp
